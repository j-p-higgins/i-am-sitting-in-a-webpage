##How to use
The website can be [accessed here](https://jphiggins.co.uk/i-am-sitting-in-a-webpage/)
Ensure your headphones are unplugged and your speakers are turned up..
Click "Enable Audio" to enable your microphone (all recorded audio is only stored on your device).
Click "Start Recording" to begin recording your loop (1-minute maximum).
Click "Stop Recording" to start the playback of the loop.
The audio you recorded will play out of your speakers and be re-recorded by your microphone.
This loop-back recording will repeat until you press "Stop Playback".

##Audio Settings
There are two configurable audio settings, "Auto-gain" and "Low-pass".
Auto-gain matches the output level of each repetition to try and avoid heavy distortion. This can cause issues on mobile devices so on mobile devices it is switched off by default.
Low-pass filtering removes high frequencies. This is only intended to be used with mobile devices as the speakers and microphones tend to overemphasise very high frequencies. This is switched on for mobile devices by default.
